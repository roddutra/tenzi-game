# Tenzi Game

The Tenzi Game is a super simple app in React where the player needs to roll the dice until all 10 die are of the same number. The less dice rolled the higher the score.

I built this app just to refresh my knowledge in React and give [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) CSS a try.

## Live Demo

You can give it a try on a demo deployed to Vercel: [live demo](https://tenzies-game-teal.vercel.app/)

## Running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Tools used

This project was created with React using [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev) and uses the following packages:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): utility-first CSS framework to make the UI look nice without having to reinvent the (CSS) wheel
- [Nano ID](https://github.com/ai/nanoid): to generate a unique ID for each die to be able to use it as the element's key
- [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): to use icons from a ton of different icon libraries
- [React Confetti](): for the confetti animation at the end of the game ðŸŽ‰
